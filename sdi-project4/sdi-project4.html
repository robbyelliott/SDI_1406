<p>While I didn't not meet my goal of doing all twelve this week I did learn more about researching
the code within the numerous sites that I found.  My catalog of links is becoming extensive and I'm enjoying
adding more with each class.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your guidance and leadership during this class. I'm certain I'll be seeing
you within other areas coming up soon.</p>
